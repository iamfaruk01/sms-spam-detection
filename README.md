# 📱 SMS Spam Detection Model

This repository contains our **academic internship project**, where we — a team of five — developed a machine learning model to **detect spam messages** from SMS data using Natural Language Processing techniques.

## 👥 Team Members
- Faruk Khan  
- Sourav Sharma  
- Mridul Roy  
- Sanjeev Iqbal Ahmed  
- Mriganka Jyoti Deka  

## 🧠 Project Overview
Our goal was to build a reliable text classification model to distinguish between **spam** and **ham** (non-spam) SMS messages.

### 🔍 Key Features
- Used a dataset of **11,500+ SMS messages** for training and evaluation.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** applied for feature extraction from raw text.
- Implemented and compared two machine learning algorithms:
  - Naïve Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
- Built using **Python** with popular libraries:
  - `Scikit-learn`
  - `Pandas`
- **Achieved 97.6% accuracy** on the test dataset, indicating excellent model performance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (optional for visualization)

## 📊 Results
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were used.
- Final accuracy on test set: **97.6%**
